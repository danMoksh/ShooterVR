## About The Project

ShooterVR is a stationary "wave shooter" where the player uses their head to aim and a single button press to fire a laser. The game environment is a simple terrain with a 360-degree skybox.

The objective is to find and "destroy" 5 spinning cubes (enemies). Once all 5 enemies are destroyed, the game loads a "Project Submitted" scene. This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental VR mechanics in Unity.

## Gameplay Features

* **VR Gaze-Based Aiming:** Uses the Google VR SDK for head tracking and aiming.
* **Raycast Shooting:** Fires an instantaneous laser using a `Raycast` and visualizes it with a `LineRenderer`.
* **Simple Enemy AI:** Enemies are spinning cubes that are "destroyed" (set inactive) when hit.
* **Win Condition:** The game tracks the number of destroyed enemies and loads a "Win" screen upon defeating all 5.
* **3D Audio:** Implements shooting sounds and background music.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Game Engine:** Unity (Version 5.4.1f1)
* **Language:** C#
* **Platform:** Android (VR)
* **Core SDK:** Google VR SDK for Unity (supporting Cardboard and Daydream)
* **Key Assets:** Unity Standard Assets (for environment details)
